                        Once upon a time in a magical land far, far away, there lived a boy named Li Wenliang.  He grew up in a quaint little village at the base of Bullshit Mountain. Deep within a dark and desolate cave on Bullshit Mountain, there grew a great evil known as Cigarettes. A group of people on the mountain found Cigarettes and sold it as “good for human consumption.” It took some time before people realized that consuming Cigarettes was “bad for human consumption,” but when the village scientists told the elders, they were dismissed. The scientists&mdash;concerned for friends and family&mdash;insisted that the elders do away with Cigarettes or avoid people interacting with it. But the elders didn’t like that. It went against what their society stood for on Bullshit Mountain. They smiled and said they would handle the problem, and they told the men to go home and be with their familes. As the scientists turned their backs to leave, they were bound and gaged or killed in cold blood. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Not long after, Li came upon a group of friends who smoked with Cigarettes, and being none the wiser, he too smoked with Cigarettes&mdash;unaware of its growing maleficence. Li took some Cigarettes home with him. His family never saw Li with Cigarettes nor did they partake in any Cigarettes, but it didn't matter because the true evil of Cigarettes was in how it could affect its consumer’s internal and immediately external environment. Cigarettes cursed his mother and father and baby brother, who suffered from hypogammaglobulinemia. His mother and father grew frail for a few days, but while she recovered with some rest, his father&mdash;a diabetic&mdash;did not. With his parents ill, Li rushed his brother to the local druid's hut. The hut was swarmed with people who had trouble breathing. The druids ran out of ventilators and sanitation equipment, and soon they too were suffering from Cigarettes’s contagious evil. Li shouted and cried and begged for a ventilator and antibiotics for his baby brother, but he only received ibuprofen. Neighbors and fellow villagers that fought so hard to help make sure his brother was born wouldn’t give up their ventilators or druidic aid for him now. But this shouldn’t have surprised Li. After all, a central tenet of Bullshit Mountain was that protecting life stopped after the womb. Everything from there on out was “up to you.” 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After days at the hut, Li had a long, solitary walk home alone. His brother’s body couldn’t fight the good fight, and so he was left in quarantine with the other bodies. Li returned home to his mom and told her his tale. She began to break down and cry. When she regained herself, she told Li how she felt his father was next. For the past few days, she had been administering Li’s father his insulin because he couldn’t care for himself. But she ran out of medication and couldn’t find any because villagers were hoarding it. That night Li’s father fell into a coma that he couldn’t wake up from. His mother lost herself in agony. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Broken and angry, Li went looking for answers. He did the only rational thing he could think to do: he went to talk to the wise old man at the top of the mountain. After days of traveling, he reached the top, and he found the old man perched upon a stone. Li asked the old man what was happening, and the old man told Li how villagers found and commercialized Cigarettes without understanding it. And when it was understood to be evil and when men warned of its maleficence, they were killed. Killed by men in power. The old man went on to reveal how those same men in power continued to believe that Cigarettes wasn’t a problem, and that they planned to continue to harvest and deal Cigarettes locally and throughout the land. The old man told Li that there was nothing he could do to stop them. The die had been cast.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Li looked out over the land. He stared down over where his village dwelt and swept his gaze out across the vast landscape beyond. He knew he couldn’t save his people, but maybe, he could save others. Maybe, he could warn others about Cigarettes and prevent at least one more catastrophic shitstorm like the one that hit Bullshit Mountain. Maybe he could save someone else's brother. Or father. Or husband. So without his things or his people, he journeyed into country to warn his fellow man.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As the months went by, more and more villages and peoples began to learn of the evil that was Cigarettes. Some people believed him. Some people began to do their own research and perform their own science to validate Li's claims. As Cigarettes made its way towards them, they were more prepared. However, some people began to question the evil and even the existence of Cigarettes. They thought Li was stupid and selfish and insane. They just wanted things to be "normal." 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Eventually, word got back to Bullshit Mountain about what Li had been doing, and the village elders did not like that at all. If Li continued to tell his tale, it would ruin them completely. So they looked for a cure for their illness. A couple of weeks later, Li was found dead with multiple stab wounds to his back. It was ruled a suicide.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But try as they might, Li's words could not be suicided. People learned. People changed. Peopled died. Nothing could go back to the way it was. The best thing that people could do to treat their ales was to prevent such an evil from being able to speard as far and as wide again.
